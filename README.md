custom conf for paparazzi

## Sync

Use sync.sh to synchronise your custom conf with the Paparazzi repo.

Untracked files will be copied to your custom conf, as well as all files that exists in your custom conf and in Paparazzi, whether it is tracked or not. 
This means that if you want to save in your custom conf a file tracked by git, you first have to copy it in your custom conf.

## Restore

restore.sh copy all files from your custom conf to the Paparazzi repo.
